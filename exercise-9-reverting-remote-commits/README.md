# Reverting remote commits

Oh no, did you commit something you shouldn't have?  
What, you have already pushed it to a remote repository?  
Then you need to `revertÂ´ them.

1. Make some changes to the code.

2. `commit` your changes.

3. `push` your changes.

4. Create a new commit to reverse the changes of the last commit using the `revert` command.

5. `push` your commit to revert the changes in the remote repository.
