# Making changes

1. Create a new feature `branch`.

2. Make some changes to the code. For example, add a third paragraph in `Program.cs`.

3. `commit` your changes.

4. `checkout` the `master` branch.

5. `merge` your new branch into `master`.

6. `push` your changes.

7. Optionally delete your local feature `branch`.

8. Go to your Azure devops repository and verify that your changes have been pushed to the `master` branch.
