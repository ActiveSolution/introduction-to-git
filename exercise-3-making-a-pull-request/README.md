# Making a pull request

1. Create a new feature `branch`.

2. Make some changes to the code. For example, add another paragraph in `Program.cs`.

3. `commit` your changes.

4. Go to Azure DevOps and create a new `pull request` from your feature `branch`.

5. Approve the `pull request`, optionally delete the feature `branch` when prompted.

6. Go to your Azure DevOps repository and verify that your changes are now in the `master` branch.

7. Go to your local repository and `pull` the latest changes from the `master` branch.
