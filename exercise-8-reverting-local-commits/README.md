# Reverting local commits

Oh no, did you commit something you shouldn't have?  
As long as you haven't pushed your commits to a remote repository you can `reset` them locally.  
If you have already pushed your commits you need to instead `revert` them, see the next exercise.

1. Make some changes to the code.

2. `commit` your changes.

4. Remove the commit by using the `reset` command.
